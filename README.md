# OpticalCharacterRecognition
Performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on "Receipt" type images to keep track of receipts using GoogleVision, OpenCV, and Tesseract. The initial approach with Tesseract had an image-to-text accuracy of 60%, and implementing OpenCV increased it to around 75%. Then, when I switched to Google Vision API + OpenCV, the accuracy rised to 95%.

The program has advanced algorithms to determine and extract essential data from +1000 receipt images within 10 seconds and exports data automatically as an Excel file.
